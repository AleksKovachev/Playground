# Password Manager

This password manager application was based on the one from lesson #29 and #30 of the Udemy course "100 days of code".
It was severely changed and expanded and has now become a fully featured application with data encryption and lots of options.
It supports 2 languages (Bulgarian and English) by default but more can easily be added. The UI was created using Tkinter.

IMPORTANT!!!
The data encryption in this version is reduced to nothing since I don't want to share the actual encryption techniques publicly.

Instructions:
Run from the main directory -> main.py file
