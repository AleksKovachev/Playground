# Snakes & Ladders

This is a small board game that is a favourite of mine since I was little and decided to recreate in Python.
The board design was taken from an actual board version I have at home and recreated in Adobe Illustrator.

Start the game from snl_main. At the moment it's designed for only 2 players and still has some work to be done.
Caution! It was created on a 2K monitor and at the moment the size is fixed at 1900x1200!
I still have some features to add and functionallity to change but this is a playable version of the game.

snl_console is the console version of the game, no UI (as the name suggests).
snl_console_colored is the same as the above but uses Colorama to color some of the text. The colorization doesn't work in VSCODE but can be tested in Jupyter Notebooks.
