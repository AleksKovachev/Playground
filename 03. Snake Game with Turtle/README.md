# Snake Game with Turtle

This is a simple Snake game created with the Turtle module. It started off from a tutorial but I later expanded on it and added some extra features to the game.
There still are a few things that need to be done but it's playable as is. Enjoy!

Instructions:
Run the game from the main folder -> main.py file.
