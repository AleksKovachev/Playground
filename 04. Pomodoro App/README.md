# Pomodoro

This small app is intended to make you more fuocused on your work and have the appropriate amount of breaks so your brain stays fresh.
As the name states, it's based on the Pomodoro Technique. You can find more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
It doesn't have the most beautiful design but it does the job. When the timer runs out the window pops up on the screen to remind you it's time for a break (or to get back to work)
