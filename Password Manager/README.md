# Password Manager

This password manager application was based on the one from lesson #29 and #30 of the Udemy course "100 days of code".
It was severely changed and expanded and has now become a fully featured application with data encryption and lots of options.

IMPORTANT!!!
The data encryption in this version is reduced to nothing since I don't want to share the actual encryption techniques publicly.
